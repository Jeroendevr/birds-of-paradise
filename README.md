### Other Birds of Paradise themes

- Repository with the [SublimeText repo](https://github.com/Colorsublime)
    - Joe Bergantine as the original creator
    - Original description "based on a warmer color palette than it’s older brother, Specials Board, it’s a little bit more natural, a little bit more tropcial. The background is a rich dark brown with complimentary colors over the top. Birds of Paradise is named for the Paradisaeidae family of birds in New Guinea from which it draws inspiration."
    - I have tried to find the real original theme, but this theme has been adapted and modified many times that searching for it was a real quest.
